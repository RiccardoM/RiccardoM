### Hello everyone! 👋 I'm Riccardo Montagnin
I'm a mobile and backend developer based in Italy 🇮🇹 

I've been an Android developer for 3 years before moving into the blockchain world where I am currently ⛓️

I'm passionate about teaching 🧑‍🏫 other people what the blockchain is and how it might affect their lifes, as well as creating open sourced projects that might help people.

When I'm not coding you can find me either sleeping 😴, in the gym 💪, in the kitchen 🍳 or playing some videogames 🎮
